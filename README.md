FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
________________________________

The potential for adding additonal features exists.  A few thoughts on adding one or more features for Capstone could include:
- Adding a "This is happening to me, too" button which could be selected by users.  By clicking the button, users would become alerted when the issue was resolved (via text or email).
- Adding geo-location information for users who click the "This is happening to me, too" button.  Track from where users are selecting that button and display with "pins" on a map.  That would give a visual representation of where issues are impacing users from a geographical perspective.  This could potentially become helpful when troubleshooting issues.
